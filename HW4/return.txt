How it went and what was done?
Decent, had to rush a bit. Had trouble with basically every part of the requirements, but eventually got it working with a lot of googling

What was done?
1) Read light sensor data
2) Ask user for permission to send notifications
3) trigger notification when light sensor value changes
4) Notification works even when not in the foreground
5) when notification is clicked return to homescreen

How do you check or prompt for notification permission?
I prompt alertdialog when app is started if notifications aren't enabled yet

How did you get your app to trigger a notification while it's not in the foreground?
Notification is triggered when Light sensor value changes and shows up even when not in foreground
because sensor listener is registered in onResume method

How did you make the notification interactable?
The notification is made interactable by setting a PendingIntent to it in the notifyUser method. 
When the notification is clicked, this PendingIntent starts the MainActivity which opens up homescreen.

What sensor are you using and how are you reading its values in the background?
Light sensor. The sensor values are read in the onSensorChanged method

What are you using the sensor input for?
For triggering the notification and showing the new light value
