How it went and what was done?
Good, had short break from homeworks so had that slowed me down a bit 

1) Input field for changing username and save it to db
2) Photo picker button and saving image to application specific storage
3) Display new username and image on homescreen

How did you implement picking an image?
By using activity result and input/output streams.
When image is picked, it will be saved with name "image.jpg". 
For homescreen if "image.jpg" exists use it, otherwise use original image

From code lookup GetContentExample and saveImageToStorage from infoscreen.kt
homescreen contains loadImageFromStorage


How did you implement text input?
Used example from material design for the input box layout.
Saved the text input to database, which is used for username on homescreen

From code lookup SimpleOutlinedTextFieldSample and saveOutput from infoscreen.kt
DB related code is found in MainActivity.kt
There is also some code for comment DB which isn't used yet

How can you store data such that the application can display your chosen image and text even when you change views or restart application?
Storing the iamge to application specific storage so permission and access are retained
