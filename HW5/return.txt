How it went and what was done?
Overall quite well, it was fun trying out the map functionality

What was done?
Audio record and play audio (basic)
Video Playback
Shows your current location on a map
Search location on map with lat and long
Get weather information through API for wanted location

Also some personal experimenting with PWA apps on android. Seems to be working quite well.
PWA stands for progressive web application which allows creating applications to mobile devices with web technologies (used by spotify, youtube, youtube music etc)
Used svelte for frontend

Implemented video recording and playing
Audio recording and Playback (didn't finish saving part, this is seen at end of the video)
Taking images and showing them

If you want to test it out yourself
Easiest way is probably:
Connect your android device to computer
Go to chrome://inspect/#devices
Check that your phone is connected
Click on port forwarding --> add 5173 for port and for ip+port add localhost:5173 --> check Enable port forwarding

Download the code
run npm run dev
Web is running at localhost:5173 on your computer
You should be able to access on your phone from localhost:5173
Web page will ask you do you want to install --> this creates the app to your phone.
After that app will work without internet connection since app is cached. If you restart the app that would reset cache --> needs connection
